The Factorial Extension to the Mass Univariate Toolbox (FMUT) is an extension to David Groppe's Mass Univariate Toolbox. The MUT implements t-tests for several different mass univariate approaches to the analysis of ERP data. The FMUT adds to this by implementing one-way and factorial ANOVA versions of the same mass univariate approaches.
